    <p class="bsc_text2">Wine Plus Cellar provides access to high quality wines at the lowest prices in town.</p>
    <p class="bsc_text1">How does Wine Plus Cellar work?  </p>
    <p class="bsc_text2">We carefully select wines to be put up into our store. All of the wines are tasted by the panel of highly professional tasters and meet our strictly standards: both high quality and the lowest price in town!</p>
    <p class="bsc_text1">For how long is each product offered? </p>
    <p class="bsc_text2">Wines are offered with limited quantity and would be put off once all of the stock is sold out. Time on shelf varies; some stays for several months because of its sufficient stock, while some flash sold-out in a few minutes due to its scarcity and status of highly sought-after.</p>
