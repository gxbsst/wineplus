      <strong>Use and Disclosure of Information, and Opt-Out Procedure</strong>
      <br>
      <p>Wine Plus may disclose Personal Information if it is required to do so by law or if disclosing Personal Information is vital to identify, contact, or bring legal action in order to protect Wine Plus, its customers, or third parties. In addition, Personal Information that you provide to us (such as your name, address and email address) may be combined with other personally identifiable information (such as demographic information and past Transaction Information) available from our records and other sources. This information will be used to make our future marketing efforts more efficient. This information may also be shared with our third party service providers that assist us with our marketing efforts and with other marketers whose products or services we feel may be of interest to you. If you prefer that we do not share your personally identifiable information with other marketers, please email us at [<%= mail_to "info@wineplus.me",  "info@wineplus.me" %>]. In the event that you choose to opt out as set forth above, please note that the following three paragraphs will still apply:
      Transaction Information will be shared with the merchant from whom the purchase is made, and may be provided to other trusted third parties as necessary to process and fulfill the order, and to help enable Wine Plus to provide better member services and offerings. All such merchants and third parties are contractually obligated to keep all Transaction Information confidential, maintain the privacy of all Wine Plus members, and to use such Transaction Information only to provide services to Wine Plus for the benefit of Wine Plus and its members. Transaction Information may also be used to develop a personalized profile and shopping history for each member in order to customize promotions, updates or special offers.
      <br>
      From time to time, we may employ other companies and individuals to perform services, to maintain and operate the Website, and to maintain certain features on the Website. To such parties, we may disclose Non-Personal Information such as traffic patterns and Website usage data, but such information will not include Personal Information. We also may employ reputable third parties to analyze our sales data for internal analysis, during which we may disclose Personal Information such as the wines purchased, the location of shipment, and the frequency of purchases.
      <br>
      We additionally may enlist a third party to assist with marketing and sending member e-mails; in this case, we will provide these third party vendors only with member e-mail addresses. These third parties will not receive or be given access to other Personal Information (such as Wine Plus member home addresses, phone numbers, or date of birth) unless Wine Plus is required to do so by law or unless disclosing such Personal Information is vital to identify, contact, or bring legal action in order to protect Wine Plus, its customers, or third parties.

      <br>
      <p>
      We are not responsible for protecting any Personal Information that you post on our blog or on social media web pages associated with Wine Plus.

      <strong>Protection of Your Information</strong>
      <br>
      <p>
      We take many precautions to safeguard your Personal Information, Non-Personal Information, and Transaction Information against loss, theft, and misuse, as well as against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. In addition to administrative and physical protective measures, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption on all web pages where Personal information is collected. For this reason, in order to complete a protected transaction, you must use a SSL-enabled browser to access the Website. Safari, Firefox, and Internet Explorer are all SSL-enabled. Using these types of browsers protects the confidentiality of your Personal Information while it is being transferred over the Internet.
      <br>
      We store credit card numbers in a third-party, one-way vault. When we interact directly with a credit card company, the card number is encrypted and only lives on the Website for a few seconds before it is transferred into the secure vault.
      When creating an account on our Website, you are required to establish a password. To maximize your level of protection, you should choose a password with at least 6 characters, using a combination of letters and numbers. You are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your password and account information.
      <br>
      While Wine Plus uses standard security procedures and practices relative to safeguarding your Information, no Internet data transaction can be guaranteed as 100% secure. Consequently, while Wine Plus strives to protect and conserve your Information, we do not guarantee or attest comprehensive security of your Information transmission. If you transmit Information to Wine Plus, you do so at your own risk.
