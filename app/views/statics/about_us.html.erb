      <strong>What is Wine Plus Cellar?</strong>
      <br/>
      <p>Wine Plus Cellar provides access to high quality wines at the lowest prices in town.</p>

      <strong>How does Wine Plus Cellar work?</strong>
      <br/>
      <p>We carefully select wines to be put up into our store. All of the wines are tasted by the panel of highly professional tasters and meet our strictly standards: both high quality and the lowest price in town!</p>

      <strong>For how long is each product offered?</strong>
      <p>Wines are offered with limited quantity and would be put off once all of the stock is sold out. Time on shelf varies; some stays for several months because of its sufficient stock, while some flash sold-out in a few minutes due to its scarcity and status of highly sought-after.</p>
